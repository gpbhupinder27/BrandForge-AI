  This key is required for all core AI generation features. The application is designed to source this key from a `process.env.API_KEY` environment variable. You will need to set this up in your deployment environment or local development server.

- **Fal.ai API Key**:
  This key is specifically for the image-to-video generation feature in the "Video Ad Studio".
  1. Navigate to the **Video Ad Studio** within the application.
  2. Enter your Fal.ai API key (e.g., `falkey_...`) into the configuration input field.
  3. Click "Save". The key will be stored securely in your browser's `localStorage` for future use.

### 4. Running the Application
Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or your configured port) in your browser to view the application.
